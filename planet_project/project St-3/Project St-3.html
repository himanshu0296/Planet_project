            <h3>Mass and Weight</h3>
            <p> Before we get into the subject of gravity and how it acts, it's important to understand the difference between weight and mass.<br>
                We often use the terms "mass" and "weight" interchangeably in our daily speech, but to an astronomer or a physicist they are 
                completely different things. The mass of a body is a measure of how much matter it contains. An object with mass has a quality 
                called inertia. If you shake an object like a stone in your hand, you would notice that it takes a push to get it moving, and 
                another push to stop it again. If the stone is at rest, it wants to remain at rest. Once you've got it moving, it wants to stay
                 moving. This quality or "sluggishness" of matter is its inertia. Mass is a measure of how much inertia an object displays.<br/>                
                Weight is an entirely different thing. Every object in the universe with mass attracts every other object with mass. The amount 
                of attraction depends on the size of the masses and how far apart they are. For everyday-sized objects, this gravitational pull 
                is vanishingly small, but the pull between a very large object, like the Earth, and another object, like you, can be easily 
                measured. How? All you have to do is stand on a scale! Scales measure the force of attraction between you and the Earth. 
                This force of attraction between you and the Earth (or any other planet) is called your weight.<br/>
                If you are in a spaceship far between the stars and you put a scale underneath you, the scale would read zero.
                Your weight is zero. You are weightless. There is an anvil floating next to you. It's also weightless. Are you or
                the anvil mass-less? Absolutely not. If you grabbed the anvil and tried to shake it, you would have to push it to get
                it going and pull it to get it to stop. It still has inertia, and hence mass, yet it has no weight. See the
                difference?
